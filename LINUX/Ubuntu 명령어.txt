This command sets the "set group ID" (setgid) mode bit on the current directory, written as ..
This means that all new files and subdirectories created within the current directory inherit the group ID of the directory, 
rather than the primary group ID of the user who created the file. 
This will also be passed on to new subdirectories created in the current directory.
g+s affects the files' group ID but does not affect the owner ID.
